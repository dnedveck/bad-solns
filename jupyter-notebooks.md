# Juptyer notebooks (or analytics notebooks in general)

- Can't edit the source files (it's a mess of JSON)
- Can't version control it effectively with git (enjoy doing a dif on nested JSON)
- why the hell would I want to do my development in a web page?
- you can't use this to create a report to give to V or C suite, so what's the point of using this semi-report generating thing? (Rmd can use custom CSS to make it look like a good report, or just use LaTeX and make a pdf).
